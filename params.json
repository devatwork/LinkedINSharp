{"name":"LinkedINSharp","body":"LinkedINSharp\r\n=============\r\n\r\nLinkedINSharp is .NET SDK for [LinkedIN](http://www.linkedin.com/). Its goals is to help .NET developers build web applications that integrate with LinkedIN.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nThe LinkedIN C# SDK currently provides an implemenation of the following APIs offered by LinkedIN:\r\n\r\n* [OAuth authorization](https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/authentication)\r\n* [Profile API](https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/profile-api)\r\n* [Connections API](https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/connections-api)\r\n\r\n## Work in progress\r\n\r\nThis library is still in development, please have a little patience. As soon as we have a stable version we will distribute it via Nuget.\r\n\r\n## Sample\r\n\r\nThe sample code belows shows how to create a client and retrieve the member profile of the authorized user.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// construct an access token, usally retrieved from OAuth authorization\r\nvar accessToken = new AccessToken( \"MY_ACCESS_TOKEN\", \"MY_ACCESS_SECRET\" );\r\n\r\n// create the client\r\nvar client = new LinkedINRestClient(\"CONSUMER_KEY\", \"CONSUMER_SECRET\", accessToken);\r\n\r\n// retrieve the profile\r\nvar profile = client.RetrieveCurrentMemberProfile(ProfileField.NameOnly);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: The sample below will not work because of a bug in [RestSharp](https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp), see pull-request [Fix for #231 Support for LinkedIn Field-Selector Notation](https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp/pull/250) for details. To make this SDK work use my fork [https://github.com/trilobyte/RestSharp](https://github.com/trilobyte/RestSharp).\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nNothing here yet, we are working on the documentation at the moment. Please visit our [Github Wiki](https://github.com/trilobyte/LinkedINSharp/wiki) for the most up-to-date documentation.\r\n\r\n## Help and Support\r\n\r\nCreate an issue on our [Github project page](https://github.com/trilobyte/LinkedINSharp/issues) if you encounter a problem with the SDK.\r\n\r\n## Help out\r\n\r\nThere are many ways you can contribute to this project. Like most open-source software projects, contributing code is just one of many outlets where you can help improve. Some of the things that you could help out with in this project are:\r\n\r\n* Documentation (both code and features)\r\n* Bug reports\r\n* Bug fixes\r\n* Feature requests\r\n* Feature implementations\r\n* Test coverage\r\n* Code quality\r\n* Sample applications\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright Â© 2012 Bert Willems and contributors\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis project is licensed under [MIT](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php \"Read more about the MIT license form\").
